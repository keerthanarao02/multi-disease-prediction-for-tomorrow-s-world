The world is facing an unprecedented challenge in the form of diseases that spread rapidly and have the potential to cause widespread devastation. The current pandemic has highlighted just how unprepared we are to deal with such threats, and it has become clear that we need better tools to detect and respond to outbreaks before they become global crises.

Traditional methods of disease detection are slow, expensive, and often ineffective. They rely on manual testing and analysis of samples, which can take days or even weeks to produce results. This delay can be deadly in the case of fast-spreading diseases, as it allows the virus or bacteria to continue spreading unchecked. We need a more efficient and accurate way to detect diseases, one that can provide instant results and help us respond quickly to outbreaks.
